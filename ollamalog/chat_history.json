What is the name of planet 9 in the milky way galaxy?
There is no confirmed planet named "Planet9" in our solar system or the Milky Way galaxy. The discovery of Planet9 was announced in2016, and it's a hypothetical planet that is thought to be a large, icy world orbiting at a great distance from the Sun.

The discovery of Planet9 was made by astronomers Mike Brown and Konstantin Batygin, who used data from the Palomar Observatory in California to identify a pattern of unusual orbits among extreme trans-Neptunian objects (ETNOs). These ETNOs are small, icy bodies that orbit the Sun at great distances.

The name "Planet9" was chosen because it is thought to be a large planet with an orbital period of around10,000 years. However, it's worth noting that Planet9 has not been directly observed yet, and its existence is still theoretical. Scientists continue to study this object using mathematical models and simulations, and more data may eventually reveal more information about its nature.

So far, there are no known confirmed planets with the name "Planet9" in our solar system or the Milky Way galaxy.
